# Chatbot_using_langchain
This code creates a simple Q&amp;A chatbot using the LangChain framework and the Hugging Face Hub's flan-t5-large model. It sets up a Streamlit app where users can input a question, and upon clicking the "Ask the question" button, it generates and displays a response from the model. The app's interface includes a text input field and a submit button.
